# Introduction to Competitive Programming (Fall 2020) Resources

From climbing coding leaderboards to competing in ICPC regionals to constructing clever algorithms with clever friends, the Competitive Programming journey starts here. Write your first contest solution and learn what it takes to start solving challenging and often beautiful algorithms problems!

* [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/) - join the [UCLA Codeforces Group](https://codeforces.com/group/XkrVYkI4KI/)
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a popular free and easy to use editor, and the C++ plugin is excellent.
* [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) is a great way to get the g++ C++ compiler on your Windows computer, integrates with VS Code, and will come in handy for UCLA CS classes like 35L.
  * Alternately, on Windows you will need to install [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)
* Mac environment setup
  * If you haven't compiled c++ code on your mac before, you will need to install clang, a c++ compiler. You can do so by running the `xcode-select --install` command on terminal, or downloading Xcode from the app store
  * Download [VS Code for Mac](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/), the superior IDE
  * Add the [C++ plugin](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) in VSCode 
  * For more detailed instructions on this setup process, check out this [post](https://medium.com/gdplabs/build-and-debug-c-on-visual-studio-code-for-mac-77e05537105e).
* Headers on Mac
  * Make sure to include the appropriate header files at the top of your cpp file. You can copy them from the [template file](https://github.com/uclaacm/intro-cp-f20/blob/master/template.cpp) in this directory.
  * A commonly method to include the entire standard library in one line is including the bits/stdc++.h header file but this is not available on mac.
* [Repl.it](https://repl.it/) can be used for quick development if you don't want to go through the setup steps (although we encourage you to set up a local environment). You can access a code editor, compiler, and shell without any setup.
